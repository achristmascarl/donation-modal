by @achristmascarl

## running

1. run `yarn` or `npm install`
2. run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
3. view the component at http://localhost:3000

## notes

- I used `npx create-next-app@latest` just to get the scaffolding started
- I downloaded the Matter font from here: https://font.gooova.com/fonts/14487/matter-font.html
